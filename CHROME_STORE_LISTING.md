Professional developer toolkit for ServiceNow engineers. JWT decoder, SAML inspector, REST API tester, HAR analyzer, and JSON utilities.

### Detailed Description (up to 16,000 characters)

NowAssist is a comprehensive developer toolkit designed specifically for ServiceNow engineers and developers working with authentication, APIs, and debugging. Everything runs locally in your browser - your data never leaves your device.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Authentication Tools
- **JWT Decoder**: Decode, verify, and analyze JSON Web Tokens with comprehensive security insights. View token structure, validate signatures (HMAC, RSA, ECDSA), check expiration, and understand key claims with ServiceNow/Salesforce-specific insights.
- **JWT Encoder**: Create and encode custom JWTs with headers and payloads. Support for HMAC, RSA, ECDSA, and unsigned algorithms with PEM and JWK key formats.
- **SAML Inspector**: Inspect and analyze SAML assertions and responses. Decode Base64-encoded SAML messages, view XML structure, extract attributes, and verify certificates.

### API Testing
- **REST API Tester**: Test REST APIs directly from your browser. Send HTTP requests with custom headers, authentication (Basic, Bearer, OAuth 2.0), and request bodies. View responses with syntax highlighting and generate code snippets for multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, cURL, Go).

### Debugging Tools
- **HAR Analyzer**: Analyze HTTP Archive (HAR) files to debug network requests. Inspect request/response headers, payloads, timing, and performance metrics. Filter and search requests, export filtered data.

### Utilities
- **JSON Utility**: Format, minify, validate, and manipulate JSON data. Features include JSON diffing, comparison, tree view, flattening/unflattening, and key sorting.
- **Encoder/Decoder**: Encode and decode data using multiple formats: Base64, Base64URL, Base32, URL encoding, HTML entities, Hexadecimal, ASCII, and UTF-8.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **100% Local Processing**: All operations happen in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.
- **No Tracking**: We don't track, collect, or store any user data.
- **No Network Requests**: Except when you explicitly use the REST API Tester or JWKS fetcher, no network requests are made.
- **Open Source**: Built with transparency and security in mind.

## 💡 Use Cases

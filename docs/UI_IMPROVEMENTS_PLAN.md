# UI Improvements Plan

## Issues to Address:

1. ✅ Dropdowns using default HTML - need custom styled uniform dropdowns
2. ✅ Response info/data not captured - need to capture response bodies
3. ✅ Equal width panels top to bottom
4. ✅ Move refresh/export to header with metrics
5. ✅ Better console log info display

## Implementation Strategy:

### 1. Custom Styled Dropdowns
- Replace all `<select>` with custom dropdown components
- Uniform styling across all dropdowns
- Better visual consistency

### 2. Response Data Capture
- Check if response bodies are being captured
- Add response body capture if missing
- Display response data in expanded log view

### 3. Equal Width Panels
- Use consistent max-width container
- Ensure all sections have same width
- Align all panels vertically

### 4. Header Reorganization
- Move Refresh and Export to metrics area
- Keep primary actions in header
- Better organization

### 5. Console Log Display
- Improve formatting of console.log data
- Better structure for arrays, objects
- Cleaner presentation
